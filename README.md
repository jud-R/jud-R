### About me

Enthusiastic software developer. I love to learn new stuff on web technologies and a little bit of DevOps.

### My stack
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `PHP`, `Symfony`,  `MySQL`
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NoSQL databases (`redis`, `mongodb`)
- âš¡ Fun fact: PHP is supposed to be dead... Really ?
